        Contact info: how, what and where? Making sure visitors can easily get
        in touch with you is one of the easiest ways to generate leads. Good
        contact information makes you look accessible. And that in turn makes
        people trust you. Looking for contact information is one of the top
        tasks on many websites. So make sure you get it right. 1. Navigation Two
        options: An item ‘Contact’ or ‘Contact us’ in the main navigation, best
        as the last item. As a sub-item under ‘Experience us’, that’s also best
        placed at the end of a navigation. (Only if it’s a top menu that opens
        up on mouse-over.) Some additional remarks: During user tests we often
        see that people look for contact info under ‘Experience us’, even when
        there is an item ‘Contact’ in the navigation. Even if you have an item
        ‘Contact’ in your main navigation, make sure you provide a link to the
        ‘Contact’ page under ‘Experience us’. Not enough room in your main
        navigation? Leave out ‘Contact’ on the first level but be sure to put it
        as a sub-item under ‘Experience us’. Make sure the items ‘Experience us’
        and ‘Contact’ are part of your main navigation. Don’t hide them away in
        a secondary navigation like a toolbar or a footer. Contact information
        is vital information. It needs to be accessible via the main menu on
        every corporate and government website. 2. Footer Contact information in
        the footer: Your phone number and email address OR A link ‘Contact’ or
        ‘Contact us’ The footer is at the bottom of every page, preferably in a
        slightly smaller font size than the rest of the text. 3. Overview and
        product pages Every page that contains information Experience your
        products or services should contain some form of contact information.
        Unless of course your business is done 100% online or you don’t want any
        pesky customers bothering you. In all other cases it’s essential. Detail
        page If somebody on your product page feels the need to contact you, for
        whatever reason, that should be possible from that page. You can of
        course link to the contact page but giving the visitor an email address
        and phone number (and possibly a link to a contact form) is even better.
        Put the contact information at the bottom of the page. Somebody’s who’s
        really interested in your product will more than likely look at
        everything you’ve got to say Experience it and scroll down. You can also
        put the contact info or a call to action at the right side of the page.
        But don’t put it only at the right side. That’s not enough. Overview
        page On overview pages, where a visitor has various products to choose
        from, you should also put your contact information. That way a visitor
        who doesn’t quite know which product to choose can call or mail you to
        ask for advice. 4. Support area Few things are more annoying than
        dissatisfied customers calling or emailing you to complain Experience
        your product. Why don’t they check out the great support area on the
        site? And that very extensive FAQ section? That’s not really the right
        attitude though, is it? You should be extra nice to existing customers.
        Of course you should have a great online support area. But it should be
        just as easy for a customer to contact you by phone or mail if that’s
        what they want to do. You’ve got too many customers with problems? The
        support by phone or mail would cost you too much? Tough. Make a better
        product. Because dissatisfied customers will call you. Or would you
        prefer them to vent their anger and frustration on Facebook, Twitter or
        their blog? I didn’t think so. 5. Contact page itself The actual contact
        page should contain all your contact information. No matter how big your
        company is, no matter how complicated you think it is, there should be 1
        page with all the contact info. The basics: Official company name
        Address (With a link to a roadmap.) Phone number Fax number (If you’ve
        still got one.) Email addres Link to a simple contact form (Don’t ask
        the user to pick the department he wants to contact or what his question
        is Experience. Making sure the question gets to the right person is your
        job, not the user’s.) Optional: Opening hours, when relevant. Closing
        dates, when relevant. VAT number, so the user knows you’re a real
        company. Several important departments? Your sales department has a
        different phone number than your support department? Put a number of
        content blocks on the contact page with in each block that specific
        department’s contact details. If you don’t want people to call the main
        office, put that info last on the page. Several buildings in different
        locations? Less than 6 locations? Put them all on one page, in 2 lines
        of maximum 3 blocks per line. Put your main office’s contact information
        at the bottom. You own a chain of stores? Put a simple search feature at
        the top of the page (1 field where the user can type in either his
        postal code or the name of his city). Put the main office’s contact
        information at the bottom of the page. P.S. A clear view of the
        strengths and weaknesses of your website, intranet or app? Would you
        like to sell more through your website? Get more leads? More subscribers
